Urinary excretion of three low molecular weight proteins: alpha-1-microglobulin, beta-2-microglobulin and kappa light chains was used as an index of proximal renal tubular function. The first urine samples of the morning were collected and excretion of proteins measured was expressed as ratio of protein to creatinine. There was a strong correlation between excretion of alpha-1-microglobulin and chi light chains and their excretion was significantly higher in diabetic children indicating decreased proximal tubular reabsorbtion. The excretion of beta-2-microglobulin was found to be an unsatisfactory index of proximal tubular function. Urinary albumin excretion was not significantly raised in diabetic children and did not correlate with urinary alpha-1-microglobulin or chi light chain excretion. Glycaemic control might influence proximal tubular function as both urinary glucose concentration and glycosylated haemoglobin showed correlations with urinary alpha-1-microglobulin excretion and with urinary chi light chain excretion.', 'The value of exercise as a provocative test for early renal disease in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes was re-evaluated. Three carefully characterized groups of males were studied: 10 non-diabetic controls, 16 diabetic patients (group 1) with normal urinary albumin excretion (less than 15 micrograms/min) and 14 Albustix-negative diabetics (group 2) with increased urinary albumin excretion (15-122 micrograms/min). Assignment to a study group was made on the basis of three 24-h urine collections, and the groups were well matched for age, weight, height, and serum creatinine concentration. The two diabetic groups were similar with regard to duration of disease (13 +/- 6 versus 16 +/- 3 years), metabolic control (HbA1c: 8.4 +/- 1.4 versus 8.7 +/- 1.3%) and degree of diabetic complications (beat-to-beat variation and retinopathy). An exercise protocol of 450 and 600 kpm/min workloads was employed. In the resting state group 2 patients had elevated systolic blood pressure compared with the normal subjects (132 +/- 13 versus 119 +/- 9 mmHg), and their glomerular filtration rate was significantly reduced compared with group 1 (123 +/- 19 versus 138 +/- 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2, p less than 0.05). During exercise the urinary albumin excretion rate increased significantly in all three groups (normal subjects: 6 +/- 0.7 to 8 +/- 1.3 (microgram/min); group 1: 6 +/- 0.6 to 9 +/- 1 microgram/min and group 2: 48 +/- 10 to 113 +/- 23 micrograms/min), the relative increase being higher in group 2 (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 'AIMS/HYPOTHESIS\\nWe analysed the contribution of the lymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase (LYP) Arg620Trp variant (which corresponds to the PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism) to the emergence of beta-cell-specific humoral autoimmunity and progression to type 1 diabetes in man. We also explored the heterogeneity in the disease-predisposing effect of this polymorphism in relation to known disease loci, sex and age at disease onset.', 'Although children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes are faced with the threat of the acute complications of hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis on a day-to-day basis, in the long-term, the microvascular and macrovascular complications of the disease place them at greatest risk for serious morbidity and earlier than expected mortality. The families of children with diabetes should be provided with information about the complications of diabetes beginning at the time of diagnosis, and this information needs to be reinforced throughout the follow-up period. Appropriate surveillance for the earliest evidence of microvascular disease should begin at the onset of puberty and after 3 to 5 years of diabetes. Therapeutic interventions, particularly excellent metabolic control, may be exceedingly effective in preventing complication onset or significantly retarding the rate of progression.', 'The importance of T-lymphocytes in the induction of insulitis and hyperglycemia in certain strains of mice treated with multiple subdiabetogenic doses of streptozocin has been a matter of controversy. To understand the role of T-lymphocytes, we treated thymectomized BALB/c ByJ mice with five daily doses of streptozocin (45 mg/kg) and determined the effect of treatment with monoclonal antibodies against T-lymphocyte subsets on the development of diabetes and insulitis. Hyperglycemia (mean glucose of 321 +/- 29 vs. 167 +/- 15 mg/dl in controls) and insulitis were induced in BALB/c ByJ mice given streptozocin. Thy1.2+, L3T4, and Lyt2+ cells were all identified within the islets of diabetic mice. There was a relative paucity of L3T4+ cells and an overabundance of Lyt2+ cells compared with the frequency of these cells found in lymphatic tissues or peripheral blood. Treatment with anti-L3T4 or anti-Lyt2 monoclonal antibodies caused a reduction in splenic T-lymphocyte subsets and attenuated the hyperglycemia to 212 +/- 14 and 197 +/- 16 mg/dl (P less than .001 and .01), respectively, compared with controls and prevented the insulitis induced by streptozocin. Our studies support the hypothesis that an immune response is important to the development of multi-low-dose streptozocin diabetes and indicate that treatment with monoclonal antibodies against the L3T4+ or Lyt2+ T-lymphocyte subsets can attenuate this process.', 'OBJECTIVE\\nTo assess and compare the long-term effects of the combination of candesartan and lisinopril with high-dose lisinopril on systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension and diabetes.', 'Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stromal cells that have the potential to give rise to cells of diverse lineages. Interestingly, MSCs can be found in virtually all postnatal tissues. The main criteria currently used to characterize and identify these cells are the capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into tissues of mesodermal origin, combined with a lack in expression of certain hematopoietic molecules. Because of their developmental plasticity, the notion of MSC-based therapeutic intervention has become an emerging strategy for the replacement of injured tissues. MSCs have also been noted to possess the ability to impart profound immunomodulatory effects in vivo. Indeed, some of the initial observations regarding MSC protection from tissue injury once thought mediated by tissue regeneration may, in reality, result from immunomodulation. Whereas the exact mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory functions of MSC remain largely unknown, these cells have been exploited in a variety of clinical trials aimed at reducing the burden of immune-mediated disease. This article focuses on recent advances that have broadened our understanding of the immunomodulatory properties of MSC and provides insight as to their potential for clinical use as a cell-based therapy for immune-mediated disorders and, in particular, type 1 diabetes.', 'This article provides a review of literature both to identify the effects of yoga-based therapy on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and to examine the social context of physical activity. Findings from the review indicate that yoga has a positive short-term effect on multiple diabetes-related outcomes; however, long-term effects of yoga therapy on diabetes management remain unclear. The context of the social environment, including interpersonal relationships, community characteristics, and discrimination, influences the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors such as physical activity, including yoga practice. Further research is necessary to determine the extent of this influence.', 'Although sulfonylureas have been used extensively in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes, controversy exists as to whether these agents act primarily by increasing insulin secretion or by enhancing insulin action. To determine whether sulfonylureas potentiate insulin action in the liver, we evaluated the ability of the sulfonylurea tolazamide to affect insulin-sensitive lipogenesis utilizing primary cultures of hepatocytes prepared from both normal and nonketotic streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Hepatocytes were cultured for 16 h in serum-free media with no additions, tolazamide alone (0.3 mg/ml), or insulin (10(-10) to 10(-7)M) in the absence and presence of tolazamide. Following culture, lipogenesis and specific insulin binding were assessed. Dose-dependent increases in lipogenesis were found in hepatocytes from both normal and diabetic rats after the chronic exposure to insulin. In hepatocytes from diabetic rats, the basal and the maximal insulin-stimulated rates of lipogenesis were only 27% and 13% of normal, respectively, establishing this as a model of hepatic insulin resistance. In the presence of tolazamide, significant potentiation of insulin action was found in hepatocytes from normal and diabetic rats although hepatocytes from diabetic animals remained relatively resistant to insulin when compared with those from nondiabetic animals. While exposure to tolazamide increased insulin responsiveness in both groups of cells, no changes in insulin sensitivity (ED50) were observed. Tolazamide significantly increased insulin binding (12%) in hepatocytes from normal rats cultured in the absence of insulin, but no alterations in insulin binding were found under incubation conditions in which tolazamide potentiated insulin action. These results give the first direct evidence for an insulin-dependent action of a sulfonylurea on the liver from both normal and diabetic rats and indicate that the enhancement of insulin responsiveness occurs through postbinding mechanisms.', 'The tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 is a molecular target of pancreatic islet autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes. T-cell epitope peptides in autoantigens have potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and they may hold clues to environmental agents with similar sequences that could trigger or exacerbate autoimmune disease. We identified 13 epitope peptides in IA-2 by measuring peripheral blood T-cell proliferation to 68 overlapping, synthetic peptides encompassing the intracytoplasmic domain of IA-2 in six at-risk type 1 diabetes relatives selected for HLA susceptibility haplotypes. The dominant epitope, VIVMLTPLVEDGVKQC (aa 805-820), which elicited the highest T-cell responses in all at-risk relatives, has 56% identity and 100% similarity over 9 amino acids (aa) with a sequence in VP7, a major immunogenic protein of human rotavirus. Both peptides bind to HLA-DR4(*0401) and are deduced to present identical aa to the T-cell receptor. The contiguous sequence of VP7 has 75% identity and 92% similarity over 12 aa with a known T-cell epitope in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), another autoantigen in type 1 diabetes. This dominant IA-2 epitope peptide also has 75-45% identity and 88-64% similarity over 8-14 aa to sequences in Dengue, cytomegalovirus, measles, hepatitis C, and canine distemper viruses, and the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. Three other IA-2 epitope peptides are 71-100% similar over 7-12 aa to herpes, rhino-, hanta- and flaviviruses. Two others are 80-82% similar over 10-11 aa to sequences in milk, wheat, and bean proteins. Further studies should now be carried out to directly test the hypothesis that T-cell activation by rotavirus and possibly other viruses, and dietary proteins, could trigger or exacerbate beta-cell autoimmunity through molecular mimicry with IA-2 and (for rotavirus) GAD.'], 'input_ids': tensor([[15269,  4793, 10140,  ..., 50256, 50256, 50256],\n",
